Kadriorg Palace (Estonian: Kadrioru loss, German: Schloss Katharinental) is an 18th-century Petrine Baroque palace in Kadriorg, Tallinn, the capital of Estonia. Both the Estonian and the German name for the palace means "Catherine's valley". It was built in 1718â€“1725 to Nicola Michetti's designs by Gaetano Chiaveri and Mikhail Zemtsov. The palace currently houses the Kadriorg Art Museum, a branch of the Art Museum of Estonia, displaying foreign art from the 16th to 20th centuries. The building of the Kumu branch of the museum, showing Estonian art from the 18th century onwards is located nearby in the Kadriorg Park.
