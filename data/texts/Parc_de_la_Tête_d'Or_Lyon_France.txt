The Parc de la TÃªte d'or (English: "Park of the Golden Head") is a large urban park in Lyon, France, with an area of approximately 117 hectares (290 acres). Located in the northern part of the 6th arrondissement, it features the Jardin botanique de Lyon, as well as a lake on which boating takes place during the summer months. Due to the relatively small number of other parks in Lyon, it receives a huge number of visitors over summer; it is a frequent destination for joggers and cyclists.
In the park's central part, there is a small zoo without charge, which includes giraffes, deer, reptiles, primates, along with other animals. There are also sports equipments, such as a velodrome, boules court, mini-golf and equestrian facility, in addition to a mini-train.
