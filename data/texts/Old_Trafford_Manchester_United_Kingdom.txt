Old Trafford is an area of Trafford, Greater Manchester, England, which borders the cities of Manchester and Salford and is two miles (3.2 km) southwest of Manchester city centre in the historic county of Lancashire. It is roughly delineated by two old toll gates; Brooks's Bar and Trafford Bar, to the east and west.
Old Trafford is the site of Old Trafford Cricket Ground, home of Lancashire County Cricket Club, and Old Trafford football stadium, home of Manchester United F.C., on opposite ends of Brian Statham Way (formerly Warwick Road) and Sir Matt Busby Way (formerly Warwick Road North). The road between them retains the name Warwick Road, and the southern section on the other side of the Metrolink line is Warwick Road South.
