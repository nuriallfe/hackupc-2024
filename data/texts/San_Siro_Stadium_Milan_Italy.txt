The football stadium in the San Siro district of Milan, Italy is commonly known by Internazionale fans as the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza and by AC Milan fans as the San Siro. It has a seating capacity of 80,018, making it one of the largest stadiums in Europe, and the largest in Italy.
On 3 March 1980 the stadium was named in honour of Giuseppe Meazza, the two-time World Cup winner (1934, 1938) who played for Inter and briefly for Milan in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s, and served two stints as Inter's manager.

The stadium will also host the opening ceremony of the 2026 Winter Olympics of Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo. It is one of the potential venues for the UEFA Euro 2032.
