Setas de Sevilla ("Mushrooms of Seville") or Las Setas ("The Mushrooms"), initially titled Metropol Parasol, is a large, predominantly wood structure located at La Encarnación square in the old quarter of Seville, Spain. It accommodates a traditional market, restaurants, a performance square, archaeological museum — and 'rooftop' terrace with a panoramic view of Seville's old city.
Selected from 65 submissions in a city-sponsored competition, the structure was designed by German architect Jürgen Mayer, was completed in April 2011, and is roughly 150 by 70 metres (490 by 230 ft) with an approximate height of 26 metres (85 ft). 
Initially beset with technical problems as well as budget and schedule overruns, the parasols are constructed of 3,500 cubic meters of micro-laminated Finnish pine and are marketed as the world's largest wooden structure. 
Since their opening, the parasols have become Seville's third-most visited urban landmark.
