The Sognefjord or Sognefjorden (Urban East Norwegian: [ˈsɔ̂ŋnəˌfjuːɳ], English: Sogn Fjord), nicknamed the King of the Fjords (Norwegian: Fjordenes konge), is the largest and deepest fjord in Norway. Located in Vestland county in Western Norway, it stretches 205 kilometres (127 mi) inland from the ocean to the small village of Skjolden in the municipality of Luster.
The fjord gives its name to the surrounding district of Sogn. The name is related to Norwegian word súg- "to suck",  presumably from the surge or suction of the tidal currents at the mouth of the fjord.
