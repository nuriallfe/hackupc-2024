The Buen Retiro Park (Spanish: Parque del Buen Retiro, literally "Good Retreat Park"), Retiro Park or simply El Retiro is one of the largest parks of the city of Madrid, Spain. The park belonged to the Spanish monarchy until 1868, when it became a public park.
The park is 1.4 km2 (350 acres), at the edge of the city centre. It is near both the Puerta de Alcal√° and the Museo del Prado. It has gardens, monuments, galleries, an artificial lake, and venues which host a variety of events. The park is surrounded by the city of Madrid.
In 2021, Buen Retiro Park became part of a combined UNESCO World Heritage Site with Paseo del Prado.
