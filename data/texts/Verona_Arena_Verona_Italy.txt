The Verona Arena (Italian: Arena di Verona [aˈrɛːna di veˈroːna, aˈreːna -]) is a Roman amphitheatre in Piazza Bra in Verona, Italy built in 30 AD. It is still in use and serves as a venue for large-scale opera performances. 
It is one of the best preserved ancient structures of its kind. In ancient times, the arena's capacity was nearly 30,000 people. The stage for concerts and opera performances decreases the available capacity to a maximum of 22,000.
