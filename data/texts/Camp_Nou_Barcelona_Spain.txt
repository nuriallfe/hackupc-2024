Camp Nou (Catalan pronunciation: [ˌkamˈnɔw], meaning New Field, often referred to in English as the Nou Camp) is a stadium in Barcelona and the home of La Liga club FC Barcelona since its opening in 1957. It is currently undergoing renovation, and with a planned increased seating capacity of 105,000, it will be the stadium with the largest capacity in Spain and Europe, and the second largest football stadium in the world.
It has hosted two European Cup/Champions League finals in 1989 and 1999, two European Cup Winners' Cup finals, four Inter-Cities Fairs Cup final games, five UEFA Super Cup games, four Copa del Rey finals, two Copa de la Liga finals, and twenty-one Supercopa de España finals. It also hosted five matches in the 1982 FIFA World Cup (including the opening game), half of the four matches at the 1964 European Nations' Cup, and the football tournament's final at the 1992 Summer Olympics.
Renovation of the stadium commenced after the end of the 2022-2023 season. Final completion of all renovations is scheduled for June 2026, although the club may return before that date. During the renovation, Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys is serving as FC Barcelona's home ground.
