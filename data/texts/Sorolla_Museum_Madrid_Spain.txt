The Museum Sorolla (Spanish: Museo Sorolla) is a public museum located in Madrid, Spain. It features work by the artist Joaquín Sorolla, as well as by members of his family such as his daughter Elena.
The building was originally the artist's house and was converted into a museum after the death of his widow. Designed by Enrique María Repullés, it was declared Bien de Interés Cultural in 1962. The principal rooms continue to be furnished as they were during the artist's life, including Sorolla's large, well-lit studio, where the walls are filled with his canvasses. Other rooms are used as galleries to display Sorolla's paintings, while the upstairs rooms are a gallery for temporary exhibitions. In 2014, these rooms presented an exhibition of David Palacin photographs of the ballet Sorolla produced by the Spanish National Dance Company.
