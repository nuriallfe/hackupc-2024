On 15 April 2019, just before 18:20 CEST, a structural fire broke out in the roof space of Notre-Dame de Paris, a medieval Catholic cathedral in Paris, France. By the time the fire was extinguished, the cathedral's wooden spire (flèche) had collapsed, most of the wooden roof had been destroyed, and the cathedral's upper walls were severely damaged. Extensive damage to the interior was prevented by the vaulted stone ceiling, which largely contained the burning roof as it collapsed. Many works of art and religious relics were moved to safety, but others suffered smoke damage, and some of the exterior art was damaged or destroyed. The cathedral's altar, two pipe organs, and three 13th-century rose windows suffered little or no damage. Three emergency workers were injured. The fire contaminated the site and nearby areas of Paris with toxic dust and lead. Notre-Dame did not hold a Christmas Mass in 2019, for the first time since 1803. Investigators in 2020 believed the fire to have been "started by either a cigarette or a short circuit in the electrical system".
On 17 April, French president Emmanuel Macron set a five-year deadline to restore the cathedral. By September 2021, donors had contributed over €840 million to the rebuilding effort. The cathedral is expected to reopen in December 2024.
