Wilanów Palace (Polish: Pałac w Wilanowie, Polish pronunciation: [ˈpawad͡z v vilaˈnɔvjɛ]) is a former royal palace located in the Wilanów district of Warsaw, Poland. It was built between 1677–1696 for King of Poland John III Sobieski according to a design by architect Augustyn Wincenty Locci. Wilanów Palace survived Poland's partitions and both World Wars, and so serves as one of the most remarkable examples of Baroque architecture in the country.
It is one of Poland's most important monuments. The palace's museum, established in 1805, is a repository of the country's royal and artistic heritage and receives around 3 million visitors annually (2019), making it one of the most visited palaces and monuments in the world. The palace and park in Wilanów host cultural events and concerts, including Summer Royal Concerts in the Rose Garden and the International Summer Early Music Academy.
The palace, together with other elements of Warsaw Old Town, is one of Poland's official national Historic Monuments (Pomnik historii), as designated on 16 September 1994. Its listing is maintained by the National Heritage Board of Poland. Since 2006, the palace has been a member of the international association of European Royal Residences.
