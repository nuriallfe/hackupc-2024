The Pont Neuf, French for "New Bridge" (a.k.a. Pont de Pierre and Grand Pont), is a bridge from the 16th and 17th centuries in Toulouse, in the South of France.
Begun in 1544 and completed in 1632, its construction was made particularly long and difficult by the violent floods of the Garonne and the unstable nature of the subsoil. The architect Jacques Lemercier, who carried out the work at the beginning of the 17th century, made it an innovative bridge for its time.
