Bahnhofstrasse is Zürich's main downtown street and one of the world's most expensive and exclusive shopping avenues. In 2011, a study named Bahnhofstrasse the most expensive street for retail property in Europe, and the third most expensive worldwide. In 2016, the street ranked ninth.

 It came into existence when the city fortifications were demolished in 1864 and the ditch in front of the walls was filled in. Until that time, the name of the location had been Fröschengraben (Ditch of the Frogs), which then was changed to Bahnhofstrasse (Railway Station Street).
Bahnhofstrasse starts at Bahnhofplatz (Station Square) in front of the Zürich Hauptbahnhof (47°22′40″N 8°32′25″E), passing Rennweg, Augustinergasse and Paradeplatz, before it ends after 1.4 km at Bürkliplatz (47.3671°N 8.5409°E﻿ / 47.3671; 8.5409﻿ (Bürkliplatz)) on Lake Zürich (National Bank).
The street is largely pedestrianised, but is also an important link in the Zürich tram network. North of Paradeplatz the street carries routes 6, 7, 11 and 13, whilst to the south it carries 2, 8, 9 and 11. Stops are served at Hauptbahnhof, Rennweg, Paradeplatz, Börsenstrasse and Bürkliplatz.
