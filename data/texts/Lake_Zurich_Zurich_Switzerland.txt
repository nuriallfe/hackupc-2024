Lake Zurich (German: Z端richsee; Swiss German/Alemannic: Z端risee) is a lake in Switzerland, extending southeast of the city of Z端rich. Depending on the context, Lake Zurich or Z端richsee can be used to describe the lake as a whole, or just that part of the lake downstream of the Seedamm at Rapperswil, whilst the part upstream of Rapperswil may be called the Obersee or Upper Lake.
