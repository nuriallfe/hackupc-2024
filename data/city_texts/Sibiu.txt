Sibiu ( see-BEW, pronounced [siˈbiw], German: Hermannstadt [ˈhɛʁmanʃtat], Latin: Cibinium, Transylvanian Saxon: Härmeschtat or Hermestatt, Hungarian: Nagyszeben [ˈnɒcsɛbɛn]) is a middle-sized, well-preserved fortified medieval town in central Romania, situated in the historical region of Transylvania (Romanian: Transilvania, German: Siebenbürgen or Transsilvanien). Located some 275 km (171 mi) north-west of Bucharest, the town straddles the Cibin River, a tributary of the Olt River. Now the county seat (Romanian: oraș reședință de județ) of the Sibiu County, between 1692 and 1791 and 1849–65 Sibiu was the capital of the Principality of Transylvania (Romanian: Principatul Transilvaniei, German: Großfürstentum Siebenbürgen). During the Modern era, the Hecht hause in Sibiu served as the seat of the Transylvanian Saxon University (Romanian: Universitatea Săsească, German: Sächsische Nationsuniversität, Latin: Universitas Saxonum).
Nicknamed The Town with Eyes (given its historical buildings with partly open rooftops), the town is a well-known tourist destination for both domestic and foreign visitors. Known for its culture, history, gastronomy or local cuisine, and diverse architecture, which includes the iconic houses with eyes that gave Sibiu its nickname, the town has garnered significant attention since the beginning of the 21st century.
In 2004, its historical center began the process of becoming a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Sibiu was subsequently designated the European Capital of Culture in 2007, a title which it shared that year along with Luxembourg City as well. One year later, it was ranked "Europe's 8th-most idyllic place to live" by Forbes. In 2019, Sibiu was named the European Region of Gastronomy. Sibiu hosted the European Wandering Capital event in 2021, the most important tourist wandering event in Europe. A European Union summit was also hosted by the town in 2019.
Sibiu is also known nationally and internationally for its very beautiful Christmas market. Renowned personalities include Transylvanian Saxon scientists Conrad Haas and Hermann Oberth, who were both pioneers of rocketry. The company Elrond, which created the eGold cryptocurrency (among the biggest in the world), was founded by people from Sibiu.
As of 2021 census, the city has a population of 134,309, making it the 15th-largest city in Romania. The proposed Sibiu metropolitan area has a population of 267,170. The town also administers the village of Păltiniș, a ski resort located 35 kilometres to the southwest.
Historically, especially during the High Middle Ages and Late Middle Ages, Sibiu had been one of the most important cultural and administrative centres of the Transylvanian Saxons (more specifically the most important). It is called Härmeschtat in their own local dialect which is very close to Luxembourgish from which it primarily descended a long time ago, during the Ostsiedlung.
